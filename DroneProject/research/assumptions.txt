- marks are made with one stroke and not damaged
    - we can try to find damaged mark by template matching over estimated area (resize template in loop)
    - we can try to find damaged mark by merging some marks in the estimated area
- marks are drawed on contrasting background
    - red marks on black background could be problem
    -> we can make a preprocessing step to turn "dark red" to "lighter red" or something that will be contrasting to white and black
- "mark string" consits of exactly two marks
- mark label is digit "0" - "9" or capital "M"

- drone position will assert:
    - marks of the same digit have similar w/h ratio
        - min and max values will be computed from db
    - marks of the same digit have similar area
        - min and max values will be computed from db
    - marks are captured from similar angle
        - needed for OCR - template matching
    - marks are close to the middle (horizontaly)
        - we can trim sides of the picture to remove noise
    - waterlevel is in the same area on the picture 
        - in case of high waves at least for some time it will be
        - What is the highest waterlevel_delta in case of really high waves?

- same ships stop at the port where the drone will be operating
    - we can do adaptive learning to get better results overtime (especially OCR - template matching)
    - we can have parameter for adaptivity
