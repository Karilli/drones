Alternative methods:
-Otsuâ€™s binarization and morphological operations for the detection of draft marks
-the Canny edge for the waterline detection
-FCN, DeepLab Family for semantic segmentation


Paper aproach:
1. mask R-CNN is used to segment the area of draft marks (semantic segmentation)
	-bad for detecting waterline due to high water feature variation
2. morphological operations - find waterline (divide image into 2 regions)
	-UNet: highly used for two class image segmentation
	-used on smaller rectangle, not the whole picture
3. MSER features - text detection
	-preprocessing: split horizontal and vertical text with average width of the mask from mask R-CNN
	-make vertical part thin, calculate quadratic polynomial of it and find intersection with waterline
	-structure analysis after tresholding -> calculate the bottom of each box and the distances between them
4. ResNet - recognize draft numbers from text
5. dataset:
	-small size, 514 images
	-trainig:validation = 80:20
	-all images were cropped to center the marks and square the image
-performs similar to human accuracy, mark detection 93%, draft calculation 98.5%
-pretrained weights on MS COCO (mask R-CNN) and ImageNet (UNet, ResNet)
-average time for inference is 0.36s per image on PC with 32GB RAM and single NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti GPU
